name: log-to-daily
description: Log conversation activity to today's daily note on demand. Use when wrapping up work, capturing decisions, or documenting session outcomes. Use when the user asks to log to daily note, capture session activity, document what was done, or record decisions made during the conversation.
disable-model-invocation: true
---

<objective>
Append a structured summary of current session activity to today's daily note. This creates the data layer that vault-analyst reads to discover your work patterns.
</objective>

<when_to_use>
- End of a work session (before closing Claude)
- After completing a significant piece of work
- When important decisions were made that should be recorded
- When the user explicitly requests logging
- Mid-session when switching contexts

**NOT needed when:**
- Just chatting without meaningful work output
- Quick questions with no decisions or outcomes
</when_to_use>

<daily_note_location>
**Default path pattern:** `00 Daily/YYYY/YYYYMMDD.md`

Common alternatives:
- `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `Daily Notes/YYYY/YYYYMMDD.md`
- `journals/YYYY/MM/DD.md`

If the default doesn't exist, check CLAUDE.md for the user's daily note configuration, or ask.

## Session Log - [TIME]

**Focus:** [1-2 sentence summary of main work]

### Completed
- [Concrete outcome 1]
- [Concrete outcome 2]

### Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| [Decision] | [Why] |

### Files Created/Modified
- [[filename]] - [what/why]

### Next Steps
- [ ] [Follow-up task if any]

---
```
</log_format>

<process>
1. **Analyze the conversation** for:
   - Main topics/tasks worked on
   - Concrete outputs (files created, code written, research done)
   - Decisions made and their rationale
   - Outstanding items or next steps

2. **Locate today's daily note**
   - Check default path: `00 Daily/YYYY/YYYYMMDD.md`
   - Create if it doesn't exist (use minimal frontmatter)
   - If path unclear, ask user

3. **Append the session log** using the format above
   - Use `---` separator before the log
   - Include timestamp (user's local time)
   - Be specific about outcomes, not activities
   - Link to created files with `[[wikilinks]]`

4. **Confirm** what was logged
</process>

<quality_guidelines>
**Good entries:**
- "Created YouTube analytics inbox item with 3 integration options"
- "Refactored authentication to use JWT instead of sessions"
- "Decision: Use Postgres over SQLite (need concurrent writes)"

**Bad entries:**
- "Worked on stuff"
- "Had a conversation about the project"
- "Did some research"

**Be specific.** Capture what was DONE, not what was discussed.

**Why this matters:** Vault-analyst reads these logs to find patterns. Vague entries = weak pattern detection. Specific entries = actionable automation recommendations.
</quality_guidelines>

## Session Log - 2:45 PM

**Focus:** Local LLM integration for cost optimization

### Completed
- Overhauled inbox-processor with local_classify integration
- Created keep-warm launchd agent for Ollama (4-min interval)
- Tested classification accuracy on inbox items (~66%)

### Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Hybrid local/cloud pattern | Local does mechanical work, Claude does judgment |
| 4-minute keep-warm interval | Prevents cold start without wasting resources |

### Files Created/Modified
- [[inbox-processor]] - Added local LLM pre-classification
- [[local-llm-hybrid]] - NEW: Pattern documentation

### Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor token savings over next week
- [ ] Apply pattern to slop-detector skill

</example_output>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Today's daily note exists (create if not)
- [ ] Session log appended with separator
- [ ] Specific outcomes documented (not just activities)
- [ ] Any created files linked with wikilinks
- [ ] User informed of what was logged
</success_criteria>

<companion_tool>
This skill creates data. **@vault-analyst** reads it.

After 2+ weeks of consistent logging, run `@vault-analyst` to discover:
- Recurring tasks you could automate
- Time-of-day patterns in your work
- Friction points that keep appearing
- Specific skills/agents to build

The more you log, the better the pattern detection.
